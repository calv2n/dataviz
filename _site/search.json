Feel free to discuss approaches to the problems with others, but you must write your own solutions. Please complete your own work and keep it to yourself. If you suspect other people may be plagiarizing you, let us know ASAP. For more information please read the Honor Code Guide for Syllabi.\nWe expect you to do your own work and to uphold the standards of intellectual integrity. Collaborating on homework is fine and I encourage you to work together—but copying is not, nor is having somebody else submit assignments for you. Cheating will not be tolerated. Anyone found cheating will receive an F and will be reported to the Center for the Student Conduct.\nIf you are having trouble with an assignment or studying for an exam, or if you are uncertain about permissible and impermissible conduct or collaboration, please come see me with your questions. Rather than copying someone else’s work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! The course staff is here to help you succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won’t need to copy any answers."

If you are a DSP student, please contact your instructors at least three weeks prior to a midterm or final so that we can work out acceptable accommodations via the DSP Office.\nFor relevant DSP accommodations that provide occasional extensions on assignments, we may provide a two-day extension as long as you contact us before the assignment is due. More details about these consideratinos may be discussed with the DSP staff.\nIf you are an athlete or Cal band member, please check your calendar. Do not take the class if you are not available to take the midterms, and/or attend lab discussions. I won’t be able to provide accommodations for an early or late exam."
